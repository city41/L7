Snake features/design doc
--------------------------

level features
-------------
-- snake gets sucked across level
	-- at different speeds depending on the level
	-- not necessarily higher level -> faster speeds, just depends on level design
-- go horizontally and vertically, and can switch midlevel
-- contain many apples to collect
-- multiple paths to take, with varying risk/reward ratio
-- hidden rooms with golden apples in them
	-- hidden rooms wont necessarily have sucking, and revert to standard snake movement



cause and effect
-------------
hitting a wall
	-- whichever segment of the snake hits the wall is destroyed
		-- typically it will be the first segment
	-- if snake drops to zero segments, game is over
	-- snake bounces back two tiles

running over an apple
	-- snake grows by one segment

running over golden apple
	-- snake grows by one segment

running over velocity arrow
	-- snake's velocity changes for set amount of time
		-- either increases or decreases, depending on arrow





snake physics (maybe????)
-------------
the snake's segments have a some what realistic physics reaction





level end goals
--------------
-- reach finish line
-- collect as many apples as possible
-- find all the golden apples in each level
-- maximize number of snake segments







first time launch the game
-------------
the very first time game is launched, the classic snake scenario is invoked
	-- user is in control of snake in classic cell phone snake game
	-- monochrome "pee green"
	-- 3 apples on board
	-- standard snake movement

once user eats two apples, the right wall explodes, leaving a hole
	-- user is free to ignore hole! classic snake mode persists
	-- if user goes in hole, advance to title screen


subsequent launches
------------
user is taken to the title screen
