switches
	-- enable bridges
	-- move portals
	-- enable portals

portals
	-- directional
	-- non directional (same direction as going in)

race another snake to end of level

snake through asteroid field
	-- move snake up and down, dodge asteroids as you go
	-- eat apples on the way

snake gets bigger -> go slower
snake gets smaller -> go faster
-- hit a button: shed a segment
-- eat apple: gain segment

have really tight maze areas where ideally snake is slow to survive
-- give bonus for beating level faster

each level can get you up to 3 golden apples
	-- get all regular apples -> 1 golden apple
	-- beat level in certain time -> 1 golden apple
	-- ????

-- speed up arrows (ala mario kart)
	-- speed your way through a tricky area
	-- speed through a level for a higher bonus

-- walls with openings that move back and forth, need to get through them without getting hit


-- giant maze levels
		-- really big (scrolling)
		-- complicated maze
		-- immune to dying from hitting wall




death animations
=======
-- when crash into a wall "squish" and have blood splurt out







probably dumb ideas
=======
push a turnstile around to operate something
