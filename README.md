# L7

This is an old game engine I wrote a couple years back. It is largely obsolete and no longer updated.

The animation system was the most interesting thing to come out of L7, and it lives on as [Plunder](https://github.com/city41/plunder)

Two other interesting things that came out of L7 are http://yaysarahandmatt.org and [this demo for Lab Adder](http://www.mattgreer.org/media/labAdder/index.html)
